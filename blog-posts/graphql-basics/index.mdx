GraphQL is an API query language and and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data.
Initially, it was developed by Facebook, and now it's part of the Linux Foundation. It is utilized by tech giants such as Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and GitHub.
In general, GraphQL is only a specification, and it has many implementations for different languages, JavaScript, Go, Elixir, Ruby, Java, Python, and more.
GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.
