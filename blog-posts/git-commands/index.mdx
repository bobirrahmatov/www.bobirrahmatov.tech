Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers collaborate on projects of any scale.

**What is a Distributed Version Control System?**

A distributed version control system is a system that helps you keep track of changes you've made to files in your project.
This change history lives on your local machine and lets you revert to a previous version of your project with ease in case something goes wrong.
Git makes collaboration easy and accessible for everyone. Everyone on the team can keep a full backup of the repositories they're working on on their local machine. Then, thanks to an external server like BitBucket, GitHub or GitLab, they can safely store the repository in a single place.
This way, different members of the team can copy it locally and everyone has a clear overview of all changes made by the whole team.
Git has lots of commands that you may use in your project. However, I've found that these commands are the ones I use the most often (and are therefore the most helpful to remember).
I hope you find them useful in your projects ðŸ˜Š.
