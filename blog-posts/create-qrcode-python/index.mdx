QR code is a type of matrix barcode that is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached. In practice, QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, or tracker that points to a website or application, etc. To create a sample QR code, first of we need to install libraries:

```shell
#png module
pip install pypng

#pyqrcode module
pip install pyqrcode
```

Once the installation of libraries is finished, we need to import these libraries and proceed to the implementation:

```python
import pyqrcode
from pyqrcode import QRCode

#destination of the URL we would like the QR code to be placed
url_destination='www.bobirrahmatov.tech'

#then creating the QR code to contain the link provided above
qr_code=QRCode(url_destination)

#this will show the QR code created
qr_code.show()
```

Very simple and easy to understand right? If you would like to re use the QR code and print on the sticker, you can save it with the following code:

```python
qr_code.png('my_qr_code.png', scale=8)
```

> Note: scale=8 is a parameter that adjusts the size of the QR code to be saved in the form of PNG, and it can be decreased or increased based on your needs.
