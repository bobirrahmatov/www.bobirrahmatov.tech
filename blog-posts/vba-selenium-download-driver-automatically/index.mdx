Selenium is a suite of tools for automating web browsers. In other words, Selenium automates browsers. That's it!
What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should) also be automated as well.

If you want to automate some projects with Selenium on Chrome or Edge browsers with Python, .NET, VBA or C# updating the latest driver manually can be very daunting task. Therefore, the below sample of the code (class module) checks the latest version of the Selenium package installed and version of the browser and it downloads the matching version of the driver with API release notes.

Please make sure to enable the below libraries, and note there is no need for Selenium Type Library as I am using the `late binding Object` method that will remove the need of installing or checking each user's current settings.

Now create a class module and paste code below. Feel free to change the code for your needs.

The code to be pasted to the class module:

```shell
