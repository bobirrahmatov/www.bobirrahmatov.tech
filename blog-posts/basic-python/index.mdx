As in every programming language, there are some `keywords` (predefined and reserved words) and `identifiers` (names given to variables, functions, etc.) in Python. `Keywords` are reserved words and they have a special meaning in Python. We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier. They are used to describe the syntax of the coding and structure of the Python language. Currently, there are 33 keywords in Python 3.7. This can vary depending on the release.

> All the keywords in python are written in lower case except `None`, `True`, and `False`.

| Number | Keyword  | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1      | and      | Logical operator it returns true if both the operands are true else return false                                                                             |
| 2      | or       | Logical operator it returns true if anyone operand is true else return false                                                                                 |
| 3      | not      | Logical operator it returns True if the operand is false else return false                                                                                   |

The list of reserved keywords in the Python release can be extracted in this way:

```python
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)
```

**and, or, not**

`and`, `or`, `not` are called logical operators in Python, `and` returns `True` only if both operators are `True`, `or` returns if any of the operators is `True`, and `not` is mainly used to invert the truth value. Some examples are shown below:

```python
>>> True and False
False
>>> True or False
True
>>> not False
True
```

Examples for the `if`, `elif`, and `else`:

```python
def if_sample(a):
    if a == 1:
        print('One')
    elif a == 2:
        print('Two')
    else:
        print('Something else')

if_sample(2)
if_sample(4)
if_sample(1)
```

The output of the above function is:

```shell
Two
Something else
One
```

`except`, `raise`, `try` are used with exceptions in Python, exceptions are raised with the `raise`, and `try...except` are used to catch the exceptions:

```python
def samplefunction(number):
    try:
        r = 1/number
    except:
        print('Exception caught')
        return
    return r

print(reciprocal(100))
print(reciprocal(0))
```

The output of the above function is:

```shell
0.01
Exception caught
None
```

`for` is used for looping. As a general rule, it is better to use when we know the number of times we want to loop. On the other hand, `while` is used for looping, the statements inside a while loop continue to execute until the condition for the while loop evaluates to `False` or a `break` statement is encountered:

```python
#for
names = ['Adam','Daniel','Joe','Biden']
for i in names:
    print('Hi'+i)
```

```python
#while
i = 100
while(i):
    print(i)
    i = i – 1
```

**Python identifiers**

An identifier is a name given to entities like class, functions, variables, etc. It helps to differentiate one entity from another so there is no clash in naming conventions. There are some general rules to follow when writing identifiers such as:

- identifiers may be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore \_. Names like sampleClass, var_one and print_this_to_screen, all are valid identifiers.
- an identifier cannot start with a number. 1variable is not correct, but variable1 is the correct naming for the variable.
- please make sure not to use keywords as identifiers at all, this will throw an error.
- special characters cannot be used as identifiers as well, such as `!, @, #, $, %`.
- identifier can be of any length, there is no general limitation.

```python
global = 1
```

Output:

```shell
  File "<interactive input>", line 1
    global = 1
           ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Python is a case-sensitive language. This means, `Variable` and `variable` are not the same thing. Please pay an attention to these details. It is always better to give an identifier that makes sense and is easier to read and understand. For example, if you are writing a code and you need an identifier for the count, it is not a good case to write `comte=100`, write `count=100` instead.
It is a good practice to separate the multiple words with an underscore, for example, `bloomberg_price_match`.

**Python statement, indentation, and comments**

Python statements are instructions that a Python interpreter can execute and run. For instance, `b = 1` is an assignment statement, `if` statement, `for` statement, `while` statement, etc. are other types of statements that will be covered in my blog later. Multi-line statements can be used when there is a break at the end of the statement in Python.

```python
numbers = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
    4 + 5 + 6 + \
    7 + 8 + 9
```

Above example is called an explicit line continuation. However, line continuation is hinted at inside parentheses `( )`, brackets `[ ]`, and braces `{ }`. For example, above multi-line statement can described as below as well:

```python
numbers = (1 + 2 + 3 +
    4 + 5 + 6 +
    7 + 8 + 9)
```

Python indentation uses indentation to define the blocks of codes, however, as you probably saw somewhere that other programming languages use `{}` to define blocks. A code block (body of a function, loop, arguments, etc.) starts with indentation and ends with the first unindented line. The amount of indentation depends on you, but it must be consistent throughout that block, otherwise, there will be an error. The enforcement of indentation in Python makes the code look neat and clean.
If you see an error of incorrect indentation such as `IndentationError`, it means it is better to indent the code. You can use the [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) package that I use in the text editor [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

**Python comments**

When it comes to writing codes, commenting is very important. Comments will help others to describe what is going on inside an app so that a person looking at the source code does not have a hard time figuring it out. Sometimes it happens a lot that, a person who is writing the code might forget the details of the blocks in a year and the block of some codes need to be changed and there are no comments provided by the developer inside the code, imagine how hard would it be to understand what is going on?.
In Python, the `the hash (#)` symbol is used to start writing a comment. Multi-line comments can be implemented by using `the hash (#)` symbol at the beginning of each line or using triple quotes `triple quotes, either ''' or """`.

```python
#This is a sample comment
#print out Hello below
print('Hello')
```

**Python variables**

A variable is titled or given name location used to store data in the memory. It is very helpful to think of variables as a container that holds data that can be changed later for another use in the app.
For example, `reference_number=123456`, here the variable name is `reference_number` and the `123456` value is assigned to the variable. Imagine the variable as a big book shop, where you can change the books anytime on the shelves. As you can see, you can use the assignment operator `=` to assign a value to a variable.

```python
url_destination = "www.google.com"
print(url_destination)

#assigning multiple values to multiple variables
a, b, c = 5, 3.2, "Hello"

print (a)
print (b)
print (c)

#assigning the same value to multiple variables
x = y = z = "the same variable"

print (x)
print (y)
print (z)
```

> Python is a type-inferred language, there is no need to explicitly define the variable type. It automatically knows that www.google.com is a string and declares the website variable as a string.

On the contrary, `constants` are the type of variable whose value cannot be changed later. Constants are usually declared and assigned in a module as a way of best practices.

Create a constant.py:

```python
google_website="www.google.com"
pi_value=3.14
```

Create a main.py:

```python
import constant

print(constant.google_website)
print(constant.pi_value)
```

**Literals**

Literals are the raw data that is given to variables or constants while coding. In Python, there are various types of literal such as:

- String literals
- Numeric literals
- Boolean literals
- Literal Collections
- Special literals

A string literal can be made by writing a text (a group of Characters) surrounded by the single(”), double(“”), or triple quotes. With the help of triple quotes, we can write multi-line strings or show them in the way we wanted.

```python
# string literals

# in single quote
single_quote = 'hello world'

# in double quotes
double_quote = "hi there"

# multi-line String
multi_line = '''Hi
           there
               all'''

print(single_quote)
print(double_quote)
print(multi_line)
```

A character literal is also a type of string literal where a single character is surrounded by single or double quotes.

```python
# character literal in single quote
character_single_quote = 'n'

# character literal in double quotes
character_double_quote = "a"

print(character_single_quote)
print(character_double_quote)
```

Numeric Literals are immutable (unchangeable). Numeric literals can belong to 3 different numerical types:

- Integer
- Float
- Complex

`Integer` - can be positive and negative numbers including 0. There should not be any fractional part.
`Float` - are real numbers having both integer and fractional parts.
`Complex` - are numbers in the form of a + bj, where ‘a‘ is the real part and ‘b‘ is the complex part.

```python
binary_literal = 0b1010 #Binary Literals
decimal_literal = 100 #Decimal Literal
octal_literal = 0o310 #Octal Literal
hex_literal = 0x12c #Hexadecimal Literal

#Float Literal
float_1 = 10.5
float_2 = 1.5e2

#Complex Literal
complex_literal = 3.14j

print(binary_literal, decimal_literal, octal_literal, hex_literal)
print(float_1, float_2)
print(complex_literal)
```

`Booleans` - are `True` and `False` and these are only two literals in Python.

```python
a = (1 == True)
b = (1 == False)
c = True + 3
d = False + 7

print("a is", a)
print("b is", b)
print("c:", c)
print("d:", d)
```

In Python, there are four different literal collections:

- List literals
- Tuple literals
- Dict literals
- Set literals

```python
cars= ["tesla", "chevrolet", "bmw"] #list
numbers = (1, 2, 3) #tuple
alphabets = {'a':'apple', 'b':'ball', 'c':'cat'} #dictionary
vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i' , 'o', 'u'} #set

print(cars)
print(numbers)
print(alphabets)
print(vowels)
```
